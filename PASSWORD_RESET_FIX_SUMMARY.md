# Password Reset Fix - Deployment Summary

## ✅ Successfully Deployed to Dev and Main

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Branches:** dev, main  
**Status:** ✅ All tests passing, no regressions

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Double-Hashing Bug
**File:** `backend/controllers/authController.js`

**Problem:** The `resetPassword` function was manually hashing passwords before saving, but the User model's pre-save hook also hashes passwords. This caused passwords to be hashed twice, making them invalid.

**Solution:** Removed manual hashing. The password is now set directly and the pre-save hook handles hashing automatically.

```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt);
user.password = hashedPassword;

// AFTER (FIXED):
user.password = password; // Pre-save hook will hash it
```

### 2. Updated Email Sender Address
**File:** `backend/utils/emailService.js`

**Problem:** Emails were being sent from `steve@juleslabs.com`, which triggered spam filters and looked unprofessional.

**Solution:** Changed all emails to send from `noreply@juleslabs.com` with Reply-To header pointing to `steve@juleslabs.com`.

**Updated Functions:**
- `sendPasswordResetEmail()` - Password reset emails
- `sendWelcomeEmail()` - Welcome emails for new users
- `sendFollowUpEmail()` - Follow-up feedback requests
- `sendFeedbackEmail()` - User feedback submissions

```javascript
// Email configuration
from: `"Jules Dating" <noreply@juleslabs.com>`,
replyTo: process.env.GMAIL_USER, // steve@juleslabs.com
```

### 3. Updated Email Branding
**File:** `backend/utils/emailService.js`

Changed password reset email branding from "Jules Style" to "Jules Dating":
- Subject: "Reset Your Jules Dating Password"
- Header: "Jules Dating - Your AI Dating Coach"
- Body: "...for your Jules Dating account"
