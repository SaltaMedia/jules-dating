## What to verify:

- [ ] "Reset Password" button works
- [ ] Reset password page loads with token
- [ ] Can enter new password
- [ ] Success message appears
- [ ] Can login with new password
- [ ] Cannot login with old password

## Troubleshooting:

### Email not received?
1. Check spam folder
2. Verify Gmail credentials in `.env`:
   ```bash
   grep GMAIL backend/.env
   ```
3. Check backend logs:
   ```bash
   tail -50 backend/backend.log | grep -i email
   ```

### Token expired?
- Tokens expire after 1 hour
- Request a new password reset

### Still having issues?
1. Check if backend server is running:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:4002/api/health
   ```
2. Check database connection:
   ```bash
   grep MONGODB_URI backend/.env
   ```
3. Check logs for errors:
   ```bash
   tail -100 backend/logs/combined.log
   ```

## Success Indicators:

From the logs, we can see:
âœ… Token generated for user: steve@juleslabs.com
