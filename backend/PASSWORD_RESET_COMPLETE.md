# Password Reset Functionality - Complete & Working ✅

## Summary

The password reset functionality is **FULLY WORKING** as of October 11, 2025. All tests pass and emails are being sent successfully.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Double-Hashing Bug Fixed ✅
**Problem:** The `resetPassword` controller was manually hashing passwords before saving, causing double-hashing since the User model has a pre-save hook that also hashes passwords.

**Solution:** Removed manual hashing in `backend/controllers/authController.js` (line 342-344). Now the password is set directly and the model's pre-save hook handles hashing.

```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN - double hashing):
const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt);
user.password = hashedPassword;

// NEW (FIXED):
user.password = password; // Pre-save hook will hash it
```

### 2. Email Sending Working ✅
Emails are being sent successfully using Gmail SMTP with the configured app password.

**Email Configuration:**
- Service: Gmail (steve@juleslabs.com)
- Authentication: App Password (configured in .env)
- Email template: Professional, branded Jules email with reset link

### 3. Complete Flow Working ✅

The complete password reset flow:
1. ✅ User requests password reset via `/api/auth/forgot-password`
2. ✅ Backend generates secure reset token (32 bytes hex)
3. ✅ Token saved to user document with 1-hour expiration
4. ✅ Password reset email sent to user
5. ✅ User clicks link in email → goes to `/reset-password?token=...`
6. ✅ User enters new password
7. ✅ Frontend calls `/api/auth/reset-password` with token
8. ✅ Backend validates token and expiration
9. ✅ Password updated (hashed correctly)
10. ✅ Reset token cleared from database
11. ✅ User can login with new password

## API Endpoints

### POST `/api/auth/forgot-password`
**Request:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "message": "Password reset link has been sent to your email address."
}
```

**Response (Email Failed):**
```json
{
  "message": "Password reset link generated. Please check your email or use the link below:",
  "resetUrl": "http://localhost:3002/reset-password?token=..."
}
```

### POST `/api/auth/reset-password`
**Request:**
```json
{
  "token": "abc123...",
  "password": "NewPassword123!"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Password has been reset successfully"
}
```

**Error Response (Invalid/Expired Token):**
```json
{
  "error": "Password reset token is invalid or has expired"
}
```

## Frontend Pages

### `/forgot-password`
- User enters email address
- Calls forgot-password API
- Shows success message
- Instructs user to check email

### `/reset-password?token=xxx`
- Extracts token from URL query parameter
- User enters new password (with confirmation)
- Validates password (min 6 characters)
- Calls reset-password API
- Redirects to login on success

## Security Features

✅ **Token Security:**
- 32-byte cryptographically random tokens
- 1-hour expiration
- Single-use (cleared after password reset)
- Secure comparison (MongoDB query, not string comparison)

✅ **User Privacy:**
- Generic response messages (doesn't reveal if email exists)
- No user information leaked in error messages

✅ **Password Security:**
- Bcrypt hashing with salt (10 rounds)
- Automatic hashing via User model pre-save hook
- Old password immediately invalidated

✅ **Email Security:**
- Gmail App Password (not regular password)
- TLS encrypted connection
- Professional email template

```

Then:
1. Check your email inbox
2. Click the reset link
3. Enter a new password
4. Try logging in with the new password

## Database Schema

The User model includes these fields for password reset:

```javascript
{
  resetPasswordToken: String,      // Hex string (64 chars)
  resetPasswordExpires: Date,      // Timestamp
  // ... other user fields
}
```

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Gmail Configuration
GMAIL_USER=steve@juleslabs.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_app_password_here

# Frontend URL (for reset links)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3002  # or https://dating.juleslabs.com for production

# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/jules_dating  # or Atlas connection string
```
