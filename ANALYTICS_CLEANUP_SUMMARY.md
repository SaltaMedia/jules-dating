# üßπ Analytics Cleanup Summary

## ‚úÖ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Session Ended Event During Registration** 
**Problem**: `beforeunload` event was firing during page navigation, causing "Session Ended" to trigger during registration flow.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `LayoutWrapper.tsx` to only track session end on actual browser close/refresh
- Used `navigator.sendBeacon` for reliable tracking on page unload
- Created `/api/analytics/session-end` endpoint for server-side tracking

### 2. **Duplicate "Onboarding Started" Events**
**Problem**: `useEffect` in onboarding page was running multiple times, creating duplicate events.

**Solution**:
- Added session storage check to prevent duplicate tracking
- Only track "Onboarding Started" once per session

### 3. **Duplicate Page Visit Events**
**Problem**: Both `segment.page()` and `segment.track()` were being called for the same page visits.

**Solution**:
- Replaced `segment.page()` with `segment.track('Page Visited')` for consistency
- Added session storage checks to prevent duplicate page visit tracking

### 4. **Redundant PAGE and TRACK Events**
**Problem**: Same actions were being tracked with both PAGE and TRACK event types.

**Solution**:
- Standardized on TRACK events for all user actions
- Removed redundant PAGE event calls
- Maintained consistent event naming

## üìä **Clean Event Flow**

### **Frontend Events** (Browser)
```
1. Landing Page Visited (TRACK)
2. CTA Clicked (TRACK) 
3. Free Profile Pic Review Page Visited (TRACK)
4. Profile Pic Review Submitted (TRACK)
5. Free Profile Pic Review Completed (TRACK)
6. Sign Up Clicked After Profile Pic Review (TRACK)
7. Onboarding Started (TRACK)
8. Session Started (TRACK)
9. Session Ended (TRACK) - Only on browser close/refresh
```

### **Backend Events** (Server)
```
1. Registration Completed (TRACK)
2. User Logged In (TRACK)
3. User Signed Up (TRACK) - OAuth
4. Feature Used (TRACK)
5. User Identification (IDENTIFY)
```

## üéØ **Event Naming Convention**

### **Consistent Naming**:
- **User Actions**: `[Action] [Object]` (e.g., "CTA Clicked", "Profile Pic Review Submitted")
- **Page Views**: `[Page Name] Visited` (e.g., "Landing Page Visited")
- **User States**: `[State] [Action]` (e.g., "Registration Completed", "User Logged In")
- **Sessions**: `Session [Action]` (e.g., "Session Started", "Session Ended")

### **Event Properties**:
All events include:
- `timestamp`: ISO string
- `session_id`: Unique session identifier
- `app_name`: "jules-dating"
- `app_environment`: "localhost" or "production"
- `platform`: "web"

## üîÑ **Testing the Clean Implementation**

### **1. Frontend Test**:
```bash
# Visit test page
http://localhost:3002/test-segment

# Expected: No duplicate events in Segment debugger
```

### **2. Full User Journey Test**:
1. **Landing Page**: `http://localhost:3002`
   - ‚úÖ Should see: `TRACK Landing Page Visited` (once)
2. **Click CTA**: "Get FREE Profile Pic Review"
   - ‚úÖ Should see: `TRACK CTA Clicked` (once)
3. **Profile Pic Review Page**
   - ‚úÖ Should see: `TRACK Free Profile Pic Review Page Visited` (once)
4. **Submit Review**
   - ‚úÖ Should see: `TRACK Profile Pic Review Submitted` (once)
   - ‚úÖ Should see: `TRACK Free Profile Pic Review Completed` (once)
5. **Click Sign Up**
   - ‚úÖ Should see: `TRACK Sign Up Clicked After Profile Pic Review` (once)
6. **Complete Registration**
   - ‚úÖ Should see: `TRACK Registration Completed` (once)
7. **Login**
   - ‚úÖ Should see: `TRACK User Logged In` (once)
8. **Onboarding**
   - ‚úÖ Should see: `TRACK Onboarding Started` (once)

### **3. Session Tracking Test**:
- ‚úÖ `TRACK Session Started` should appear once per session
- ‚úÖ `TRACK Session Ended` should only appear on browser close/refresh
- ‚ùå `TRACK Session Ended` should NOT appear during page navigation

## üö® **What to Watch For**

### **‚úÖ Success Indicators**:
- Events appear in correct chronological order
- No duplicate events with same timestamp
- Session Ended only on browser close/refresh
- Consistent TRACK event types
- Proper event naming convention

### **‚ùå Failure Indicators**:
- Duplicate events with identical timestamps
- Session Ended during page navigation
- Mixed PAGE and TRACK events for same actions
- Events out of chronological order
- Inconsistent event naming

## üìà **Mixpanel Funnel Setup**

With clean events, you can now create accurate funnels:

### **Registration Funnel**:
1. `Landing Page Visited`
2. `CTA Clicked`
3. `Registration Completed`
4. `User Logged In`

### **Profile Pic Review Funnel**:
1. `Landing Page Visited`
2. `CTA Clicked`
3. `Free Profile Pic Review Page Visited`
4. `Profile Pic Review Submitted`
5. `Free Profile Pic Review Completed`
6. `Sign Up Clicked After Profile Pic Review`

### **Feature Usage Tracking**:
- `Feature Used` with properties: `feature`, `action`, `category`

## üîß **Maintenance**

### **Adding New Events**:
1. Use consistent naming convention
2. Add session storage checks for page-level events
3. Include standard properties (timestamp, session_id, etc.)
4. Test for duplicates

### **Monitoring**:
1. Check Segment debugger regularly for duplicates
2. Verify event order matches user actions
3. Monitor session tracking accuracy
4. Validate Mixpanel funnel data

The analytics system is now clean, consistent, and ready for accurate funnel analysis! üéâ
